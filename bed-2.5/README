About
-----

This package is an implementation of the Boolean Expression Diagrams
data structure and algorithms. It provides a C library (with both C
and C++ interfaces) as well as a simple shell-like program for
experimenting with BEDs.

The BED webpage contains more information:

	http://www.it-c.dk/research/bed/


Contents
--------

This distribution contains five sub-directories:

libutil	Library containing a number of utilities used by the BED library
libbed	Library containing the core BED data structure and algorithms
	for manipulating this data structure. 
libshell and
shell	implements a user shell on top of the BED library. Commands to
	build, manipulate, inspect and view BED can be issued at a
	prompt.
doc	Contains documentation on how to use the BED shell and how to use
	the libraries. At the moment the documentation is rather limited.


Two extra directories will be created during the installation:

bin	contains the binaries.
lib	contains the libraries.


Installation
------------

To build the BED package, do the following in this directory:

	gmake depend
	gmake

If the make process fails, you may have to modify the top portion of
the Makefile in the top directory. If the process succeeds, the
program 'bed' is built in the directory './bin'. If you don't have
gcc, any other ANSI cc compiler should do, although you will probably
need to modify the Makefiles slightly.

To display the BEDs, you will need the 'dot' program which can be
obtained from AT&T:

BED also expects to find 'ghostview' on your system.

The BED package has been successfully compiled on the following systems:

	Sun Sparc 4, SunOS 4.1.4 with gcc 2.7.2.
	Pentium PC running Linux with gcc 2.8.1 and 2.91.66.
	DEC Alpha, OSF 1 V4.0 with gcc 2.8.1.


Comments or bug reports

reports, fixes, or enhancements, send e-mail to one of the authors:
