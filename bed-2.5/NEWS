Version 2.5
-----------

* FORALL is now treated as an operator and no longer as "NOT EXISTS
  NOT".

* Caches have been merged. Programmers can now use "cache.h" to cache
  intermediate results.

* C++ interface added.

* BED_UPSOME added (a mix between UPALL and UPONE).

* BED_SIMPLIFY added.

* BED_QUANTDOWN added for scope reduction of quantifiers.

* Another external gc hook added.

* "writeorder" in the shell now outputs the current variable ordering
  to a file. It can be read using "source".

* "fanin" and "fanout" added as variable ordering methods.

* Root lists can now be specified explicitly "[R1 R2 R3]", by prefix
  "R*", or all roots at once "*".

* "roots" / "outputs" / "lets" commands now take a root list as an
  optional argument.

* "foreach" shell command added. Cycle through all roots:

  > foreach root do "echo root"

  Cycle through selected roots:

  > foreach root in R* do "echo root"

* "depth" shell command add.

* Fixed bug in data structure used for GC.

* "bedsat" command added for satisfiability checking. ("bedsat"
  searches for 1, "bedunsat" searches for 0.)
